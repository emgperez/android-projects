# Tour Guide App

- Being born in Madrid, I thought of all the places in Madrid I've been to and made a list of them divided by location (West, East, North, Center) 

# Features 

- Four Fragments, one for each location (West, East, North, Center)

- Fragment Adapter, helping display those Fragments into tabs.
