# Idiomatic German Quiz App

- I've been learning German for quite some time and I thought it would be original to have an app to test your idiomatic use of the language. 

# Features 

-Twelve questions including mainly radio buttons, a check box and a text entry. The questions and answers have been mostly taken from http://www.funtrivia.com/playquiz/quiz141815103e0d0.html

-Two buttons:

	- CHECK ANSWERS: after checking all the answers, a Toast message with the score will be displayed.
	- RESET QUIZ: when pressing it, the text entry as well as all the radio buttons and check boxes 
	previously selected will be cleared, and the number of correct answers set to zero. 
	A Toast message will indicate the quiz has been reset.
