# Tennis Counter App

- This app implements a three-setter tennis match. There's two players (named 'FED' and 'NAD' -I know, they sound familiar-) and any of them can score by hitting an ace, a winner or thanks to an unforced error from the other player. Each one of those three actions has its own button.

# Features 

-Two players

-Three buttons for each player

	- ACE
